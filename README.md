# Choclate Factory Simulation

A multi-threaded multi-processing application that simulates the behavior of a chocolate-manufacturing factory., written in C & OpenGL, using Linux IPC techniques for synchronization. 

> this project is a part of the **Real Time Applications & Embedded Systems (ENCS4330)** course at [BZU](https://www.birzeit.edu).

## Installation

to make the project portable, [Docker](https://www.docker.com) containers were used as a runtime enviroment.

### Prerequisites ‚úÖ
* To run in a docker container
    
    * Docker : to make the project portable, [Docker](https://www.docker.com) containers were used as a runtime enviroment.

    * VNC client
    
* To run in a virtual machine
    * just a desktop linux

### Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

> the folowing commands are intended to be run in a bash shell

1. clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone  https://github.com/ibraheemalayan/factory_opengl_simulation.git real_time_project_3
    cd real_time_project_3
    mkdir src/bin
    ```

> if working inside a desktop linux VM, you are ready to run the makeFile, the following steps are intended for docker installtion

2. (docker insalltion only) setup the container
    * windows
        ```bash
        bash windows_setup.sh
        ```
    * unix/linux
        ```bash
        bash setup_container.sh
        ```
3. connect the VNC client to the url shown in the output of the setup script (password is `headless`)


4. inside the container shell, run the intended make command.


> Note: before running the gui from an ssh session
> 
> ```
> export DISPLAY=:0
> ```

### Usage ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

> makeFile is inside the `src` directory

Available make commands:

> FIXME ( update those commands )
* `make run <num_of_rounds>` - run the project in gui mode
* `make run_gui` - run the standalone gui code with default number of rounds and random speeds **(for testing)**
* `make run_cli <num_of_rounds>` - run the project in cli mode without gui **(for testing)**

Debugging (GDB)

> FIXME ( update those commands )
* `make debug <num_of_rounds>` - run the project inside gdb
* `make debug_cli <num_of_rounds>` - run the project in cli mode without gui inside gdb **(for testing)**
* `make debug_gui` - run the project in gui mode inside gdb **(for testing)**


> there other make commands, but they are not intended to be used directly.

#### Debugging in gdb üêû

* to follow child in forks
```
set follow-fork-mode child
```


* to follow new process after exec 
```
set follow-exec-mode new
```
